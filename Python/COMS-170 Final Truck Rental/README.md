# Introduction to Programming Final Project - Truck Rental Calculator
The Python file for the primitive rental cost calculator made for COMS-170.

## File Use
Primarily this file is here for reference to my coding habits, but if you want to see the program run, you merely have to download the file and have Python installed.

## Writeup
**Goal:** Compute and display estimated moving truck rental cost. Estimated cost will be calculated depending on variables of truck type, daily or weekly rental, time rented, and mileage.

**Features:** A nested list used to store daily vs weekly rates, a global variable used to hold the mileage not charged for weekly rentals, a main() function to keep the entire program contained, and a loop that keeps going until the user chooses to terminate.

**End Result:** This project challenged me to work with menu loops, nested lists, somewhat complex math, and functions in Python. It was a voluntary exercise in critical thinking and problem solving, as I had already completed and submitted the other option for the final project at the time I worked on this one.
