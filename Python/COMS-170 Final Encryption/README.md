# Introduction to Programming Final Project - "Encryption" Tool
The Python file for the primitive "encryption" tool made for COMS-170.
Created by Levi Zelley in December of 2021.

## File Use
Primarily this file is here for reference to my coding habits, but if you want to see the program run, you merely have to download the file and have Python installed.

## Writeup
**Goal:** Encrypt or decrypt user input by mapping one character from user input onto another for output, displaying the altered message back to the user.

**Features:** Try/except error handling, menu looping, parallel lists and indexing, main() function to keep the program contained.

**End Result:** This project challenged me to work with menu loops, parallel lists, indexing, and functions in Python. It was a good exercise in cutting down on bulky and repetitive code, and helped me significantly in learning how to optimize my code.
