# Advanced .NET Programming Final Project - Prompt Generator
The Visual Studio files to the Prompt Generator I made for COMS-276.
Created by Levi Zelley in April of 2025.

## File Use
Primarily these files are here for reference to my coding habits, but if you want to see the program run, you should need only the Debug folder (LZelley Final Project/bin/x64/Debug) and to run the .exe file contained within. Otherwise you may have to download the folder, change all references in the project to the location you've stored it, and run the site in Visual Studio's debugger.

## Writeup
**Goal:** Create a Windows form project for class in C# that utilizes at least three forms, interacts with a data source of at least 500 records, utilizes HTML reporting onscreen, deploys with a setup application, includes at least one class object, and is documented with XML documentation.

**Features:** A class object used to store global appearances across all three forms, a Microsoft Access database with over 500 records, a series of checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus that effect how the queries for access are constructed, and the ability to add records.

**End Result:** This program challenged me to access databases both to view existing records and to add new records, and to use HTML reporting to present information to the user. Overall, it was good continued practice with databases and worked fantastically as a prototype for the Inspirize website.
