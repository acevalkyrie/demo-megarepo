# Introduction to .NET Programming Final Project - Personality Quiz
The Visual Studio files to the personality quiz I made for COMS-176.
Created by Levi Zelley in April of 2022.

## File Use
Primarily these files are here for reference to my coding habits, but if you want to see the file run, you should only need to download the .exe file located in Final Project/bin/Debug.

## Writeup
**Goal:** Create a program for class with appropriate form design, meaningfully named controls and variables, a functioning close button, conditional statements, methods, text file access, lists, and class objects; all with informative inline documentation.

**Features:** Used clsQuizQuestions class to make it easy to create and add questions to the quiz, question counter, restart/retake buttons that work from either form, radio buttons that reset to allow user to pick their answer for each question, public reference to the first form that the second form can use for this purpose, and second results form. All images are pulled from resources, so that the quiz won't rely on other files in the same folder to display properly.

**End Result:** This project challenged me to go above and beyond the requirements of the assignment, teaching myself how to store files in resources and to reference/affect one form from another. I gained a strong idea of the capabilities of .NET programming in Visual Studio.
