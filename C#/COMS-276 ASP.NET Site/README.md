# Advanced .NET Programming ASP.NET site
The Visual Studio files to the ASP.NET site I made for COMS-276.
Created by Levi Zelley in March of 2025.

## File Use
Primarily these files are here for reference to my coding habits, but if you want to see the site run, you may have to download the folder, change all references in the project to the location you've stored it, and run the site in Visual Studio's debugger.

## Writeup
**Goal:** Create a website for class using ASP.NET, C#, database access, and XML documentation that has a landing page, an about me page, a page that interacts with the colors selected by the user, and a page that loads from a database and displays information using in-browser alert windows.

**Features:** Colors and data in the .aspx files are drawn from the associated .cs files. Colors of items placed in design view and backgrounds are affected in .cs files by user input. A database connection is used to populate the movies page, and C# is used to display the title of the selected record in an alert. 

**End Result:** This COMS-276 assignment didn't allow for much creativity or straying from the example we were given, but I was pleased to learn ASP.NET I challenged myself to flex beyond the boundaries of the assignment wherever I could.
