# AceValkyrie Project Hosting
Mega repository used to store smaller repositories of any program or application I've coded that is hosted nowhere else. Will include programs created for college courses, programs created for fun, and programs created to learn or refamiliarize myself with certain coding concepts.

## Repo Use
Many of these programs are very simple and primitive, and are only intended for employers to reference and familiarize themselves with how I work. The files are mostly intended to be viewed in GitHub, and it's not really encouraged for anyone to use any code from this folder as a basis for their own work.

## Upcoming Changes
 - Upload completed programs/applications
